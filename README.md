# VizCollapse Photon Simulation

This repository contains a minimal example of a photon movement simulation. The photon travels along the Y axis at a configurable speed. When the photon reaches the detector, the detector is highlighted.

## Usage

Open `src/index.html` in your browser to run the simulation.
